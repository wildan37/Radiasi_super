This code is aimed at solving a Markovian master equation [see Eq. 1 in T. Maier et al, OPTICS EXPRESS 22, 11 (2014) ] for the case of superradiance of a few strontion atoms which are placed in neighbouring sites of a one-dimensional lattice. A density matrix method is employed and propagations are performed by means of Runge-Kutta method. 

The code consists of five parts: (i) mimitian_radsup.c - contains parameters, initial conditions, and allocation memories; (ii) carana_radsup.c - contains function generator and integration of first order differential equations; (iii) inti_radsup.c - the main program to call all the functions; (iv) sirah_radsup.h - the header of the program; (v) mt19937ar.c - a library pseudo random number of mersenne twister (you may ignore this one as this will be needed for the trajectory one).

Type 'make' to compile the code and one needs gsl library that can be downloaded here https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/. Do not hesitate to aske me should there any question.
